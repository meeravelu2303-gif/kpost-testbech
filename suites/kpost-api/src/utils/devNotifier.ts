/**
 * Developer Digest — the human-readable summary of a run, and the webhook payloads that
 * carry it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a generator, not another dispatcher
 *
 * `reporters/send-webhook-alert.ts` and `reporters/send-email-report.ts` already own
 * *delivery*: SMTP, Slack/Teams payload shaping, timeouts, and the fail-safe behaviour that
 * stops an unreachable webhook from failing a test run. Duplicating any of that here would
 * be exactly the redundancy this module was asked to avoid.
 *
 * What did not exist is the **digest itself**: a grouped, triage-ready summary broken down by
 * severity, module and assigned owner, produced as a durable artifact that can be read
 * without running Playwright.
 *
 * So this module is deliberately **pure and side-effect-light**: it reads `BUG_REPORT.json`,
 * builds the digest, and writes two files. It sends nothing. The dispatchers can consume
 * `buildWebhookPayload()`, CI can read `DEV_DIGEST.md`, and a human can open it in a browser
 * or paste it into a ticket.
 *
 * Reading `BUG_REPORT.json` rather than the in-memory run model is what makes it runnable
 * standalone (`npm run notify`) long after the run finished — useful when someone asks "what
 * did last night's run find?" and nobody wants to re-run 3,900 tests to answer.
