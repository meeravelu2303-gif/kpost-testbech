## Verdict: PRODUCTION-READY — 97/100

| Category | Score | Basis |

| 3. Zero Redundancy & Wiring | 25/25 | no duplicates 15/15 · every spec dir registered 10/10 |
| 4. Reporting & Actionability | 25/25 | curl 8/8 · snippet 5/5 · owner 4/4 · artifacts 8/8 |
| **Total** | **97/100** | |

## How to disagree with this score

Each category is arithmetic on the evidence table, not a judgement:

- **Architecture** rewards a clean compile, zero duplicate route signatures, and an
  ownership registry that still covers the contract. It does *not* attempt to score
  "clean structure" — that is a code-review judgement a generator has no business
  awarding itself.
- **Bug detection** scores the 10-case floor and coverage breadth. It cannot measure
  whether the assertions are *good*, only that they exist and are numerous, so a high
  score here is necessary but not sufficient. `npm run audit:vectors` is the check
  that grades *which* vectors those cases cover.
- **Redundancy & wiring** is fully mechanical.
- **Reporting** counts the proportion of ledger entries that carry a curl command, a
  Playwright snippet and an owning team, plus the proportion of expected artifacts that
  actually exist on disk.

A verdict of PRODUCTION-READY requires 90+. That threshold is about the *test suite*,
not the API under test — the API itself is failing its own release gate, and the
defect counts above are the reason.
