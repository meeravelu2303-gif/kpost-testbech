/**
 * Pushes the finished run to the external QA Dashboard.
 *
 * The dashboard is a separate product in its own repository: it serves 10+ test
 * benches, owns its schema, its users and its uptime. This bench therefore knows
 * nothing about that storage — it POSTs one JSON document and forgets. No
 * database driver, no connection string, no schema knowledge, and nothing new in
 * `package.json`: the POST uses Node's built-in `fetch`.
 *
 * **Must stay LAST in `playwright.config.ts`.** Reporter `onEnd` hooks run in
 * array order and this reads `BUG_REPORT.json`, which `src/reporters/bugReporter.ts`
 * writes in its own `onEnd`. Placed any earlier it would upload the *previous*
 * run — the same ordering constraint that keeps `kpost-master-reporter` ahead of
 * `bugReporter`.
 *
 * Fail-safe by construction, exactly like the dispatchers in `send-*.ts`: it
 * returns rather than throws, and prints one line whatever happens. An
 * unreachable dashboard must never change a test run's exit code — the run's own
 * result is the product, and this is telemetry about it.
